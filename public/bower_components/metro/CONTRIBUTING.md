## Pull Request Guidelines
The `master` branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

To create pull request:
- Each pull request should close `one problem`.
- Check that you are using the latest version of the library.
- Create pull request to the `latest develop branch` (greatest number).
- The patch must contains only files in source folders: `less` and `js`.
- The patch to `docs` must contains only `html` files in the `docs` folder.
- Add patch keyword to your pull request title: `fix bug`, `update feature`, `add feature`.
- If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title.
